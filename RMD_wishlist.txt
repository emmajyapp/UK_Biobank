Main RMD

* Variable list
* List of numbered analysis steps
o Load packages
o Read data and create appropriate dataset
o Create variables
o Descriptives
o LCA
o LCA for males and females separately
o Assessment of need for multiple group LCA (difference in deviance, must be nested models, need to work out how to contrain parameters)
o Assign people to groups
o Do confounder, moderator, mediator analysis
o Conduct logistic regressions
o Adjust p-values accordingly

Checks

* List of numbered checks by relevant grouping e.g. 1.1, 2.3
* Descriptives
o Check for outliers in descriptives, compare to Davies results.
* LCA
o Create correlation matrix of raw data
o Examine class probabilities across items and compare to correlation data
o Check the line graph for the observed vs model-predicted data
o Check for correlations between classes
o Check for correlations between factor residuals
o Tabulate observed, expected, and bivariate residuals https://gist.github.com/daob/883fbffdff6762c3bb90b3d8d3d0ae6e 
o Within classes - check correlations between items to assess for local dependence
* Assigning people to groups
o Inspect class probabilities, individual responses, and missing data to assess whether class assignment looks feasible. DO this for top 100 and bottom 100.
o Regress item responses on covariates  ?
